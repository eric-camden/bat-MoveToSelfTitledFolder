# bat-MoveToSelfTitledFolder
This is a simple Windows batch script that creates a new folder (named after the script itself, without the .bat extension) and moves all files from the current directory that are not already in a subfolder into that newly created folder. (without the .bat extension). It's useful for organizing scripts or grouping related files into appropriately named directories.
